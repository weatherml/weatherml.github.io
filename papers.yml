  abstract: "FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global\

    \ global predictions at 0.25\u25E6 resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts\
    \ high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation,\
    \ and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind\
    \ energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones,\
    \ extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting\
    \ accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art\
    \ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale\
    \ variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure,\
    \ including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less\
    \ than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet\
    \ enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with\

  abstract: Ensemble forecasting is a crucial technique for quantifying uncertainty
    in weather prediction. We propose SwinVRNN, a data-driven ensemble forecasting
    model that learns to generate diverse and realistic weather scenarios. SwinVRNN
    combines a Swin Transformer with a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)
    to model the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere. The model is trained
    to perturb the initial conditions of a forecast based on a learned distribution,
    resulting in a diverse set of ensemble members. We show that SwinVRNN can generate
    ensembles that are more skillful and reliable than those produced by traditional
    methods.

  title: Using machine learning to downscale coarse-resolution environmental variables
    for understanding the spatial frequency of convective storms
  authors: Hungjui Yu, Lander Ver Hoef, Kristen L. Rasmussen, Imme Ebert-Uphoff
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.08802v1
  abstract: Global climate models (GCMs), typically run at ~100-km resolution, capture
    large-scale environmental conditions but cannot resolve convection and cloud processes
    at kilometer scales. Convection-permitting models offer higher-resolution simulations
    that explicitly simulate convection but are computationally expensive and impractical
    for large ensemble runs. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a bridge
    between these approaches. We train simple, pixel-based neural networks to predict
    convective storm frequency from environmental variables produced by a regional
    convection-permitting model. The ML models achieve promising results, with structural
    similarity index measure (SSIM) values exceeding 0.8, capturing the diurnal cycle
    and orographic convection without explicit temporal or spatial coordinates as
    input. Model performance declines when fewer input features are used or specific
    regions are excluded, underscoring the role of diverse physical mechanisms in
    convective activity. These findings highlight ML potential as a computationally
    efficient tool for representing convection and as a means of scientific discovery,
    offering insights into convective processes. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
    which depend on spatial structure and grid size, the pixel-based model treats
    each grid point independently, enabling value-to-value prediction without spatial
    context. This design enhances adaptability to resolution changes and supports
    generalization to unseen environmental regimes, making it particularly suited
    for linking environmental conditions to convective features and for application
    across diverse model grids or climate scenarios.

  title: Nuclear Data Adjustment for Nonlinear Applications in the OECD/NEA WPNCS
    SG14 Benchmark -- A Bayesian Inverse UQ-based Approach for Data Assimilation
  authors: Christopher Brady, Xu Wu
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.07790v1
  abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
    Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to assess
    the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to nonlinear
    applications and experiments with low correlation to applications. This work introduces
    Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a method for nuclear data
    adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the more traditional methods
    of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior
    predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications.
    When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ posterior predictions to computed model responses
    using adjusted parameters, we observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate
    computed response distributions for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows
    near agreement, and IUQ uses computed model responses directly. We also discuss
    observations on why experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative
    to nuclear data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
    for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark indicates
    potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.

  title: 'FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching
    and ODE Integration'
  authors: Shuangshuang He, Yuanting Zhang, Hongli Liang, Qingye Meng, Xingyuan Yuan
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14775v1
  abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
    Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals,
    yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge.
    This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts
    and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle.
    To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric
    state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow
    path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally
    with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine
    strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching
    and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation
    (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight
    low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by
    15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms
    strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy
    conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details.
    It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting
    extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities
    associated with assimilation cycle transitions.

  title: Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiscale Data Assimilation in Physical Domain based
    on Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System
  authors: Hyeonggeun Yun, Quanling Deng
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14586v1
  abstract: This research aims to further investigate the process of Lagrangian-Eulerian
    Multiscale Data Assimilation (LEMDA) by replacing the Fourier space with the physical
    domain. Such change in the perspective of domain introduces the advantages of
    being able to deal in non-periodic system and more intuitive representation of
    localised phenomena or time-dependent problems. The context of the domain for
    this paper was set as sea ice floe trajectories to recover the ocean eddies in
    the Arctic regions, which led the model to be derived from two-layer Quasi geostrophic
    (QG) model. The numerical solution to this model utilises the Conditional Gaussian
    Nonlinear System (CGNS) to accommodate the inherent non-linearity in analytical
    and continuous manner. The normalised root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern
    correlation (Corr) are used to evaluate the performance of the posterior mean
    of the model. The results corroborate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer
    QG model in physical domain. Nonetheless, the paper still discusses opportunities
    of improvement, such as deploying neural network (NN) to accelerate the recovery
    of local particle of Lagrangian DA for the fine scale.

    Numerical investigation of stability'
  authors: Erik Burman, Janosch Preuss, Tim van Beeck
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.13108v1
  abstract: In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation
    problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral
    boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz
    stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising
    optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether
    these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity.
    Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe
    that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far
    more demanding than in the homogeneous case.

  abstract: 'Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system

  abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
    events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution
    (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While
    machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed

    a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This
    research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in
    diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to
    climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability
    across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models.
    These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide
    actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.

  title: Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models
  authors: Kevin Valencia, Ziyang Liu, Justin Cui
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.11047v1
  abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
    recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
    promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive
    and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science,
    where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we
    explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion
    models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time
    stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data
    training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs
    only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results
    demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for
    weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
    methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

  title: Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global
    Weather Forecasting
  authors: Zinan Zheng, Yang Liu, Jia Li
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.20911v1
  abstract: 'Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting,
    which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme
    weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for
    training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability
    to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting
    that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring
    the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we
    propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular
    weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially
    irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2)
    leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance
    spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation
    dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models.
    Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable

    solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using
    a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work
    demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification
    capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov

  title: Physics-Informed Field Inversion for Sparse Data Assimilation
  authors: Levent Ugur, Beckett Y. Zhou
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.19160v1
  abstract: Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering applications,
    given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these approaches,
    such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting low-fidelity
    models by leveraging available observations of the problem. However, the solely
    data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally requires dense observations
    that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study, we propose a physical loss
    term addition to the field inversion stage of the FIML technique similar to the
    physics-informed machine learning applications. This addition embeds the complex
    physics of the problem into the low-fidelity model, which allows for obtaining
    dense gradient information for every correction parameter and acts as an adaptive
    regularization term improving inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed
    Field Inversion approach is tested using three different examples and highlights
    that incorporating physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for
    limited data cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally,
    this modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter
    distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase
    in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an acceptable
    level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.

  title: Comparing Data Assimilation and Likelihood-Based Inference on Latent State
    Estimation in Agent-Based Models
  authors: Blas Kolic, Corrado Monti, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Marco Pangallo
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.17625v1
  abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation
    (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models
    (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent
    microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world
    data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based
    models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs
    poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation
    of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates
    the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially
    less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly
    leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,
    model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive.
    We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion
    dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar
    opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under
    model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the
    aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive
    across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest
    that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for
    agent-level inference.

  arxiv: 2509.17252v1
  abstract: Understanding the role of human behavior in shaping environmental outcomes
    is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change. Environmental
    systems are influenced not only by natural factors like temperature, but also
    by human decisions regarding mitigation efforts, which are often based on forecasts
    or predictions about future environmental conditions. Over time, different outcomes
    can emerge, including scenarios where the environment deteriorates despite efforts
    to mitigate, or where successful mitigation leads to environmental resilience.
    Additionally, fluctuations in the level of human participation in mitigation can
    occur, reflecting shifts in collective behavior. In this study, we consider a
    variety of human mitigation decisions, in addition to the feedback loop that is
    created by changes in human behavior because of environmental changes. While these
    outcomes are based on simplified models, they offer important insights into the
    dynamics of human decision-making and the factors that influence effective action
    in the context of environmental sustainability. This study aims to examine key
    social dynamics influencing society's response to a worsening climate. While others
    conclude that homophily prompts greater warming unconditionally, this model finds
    that homophily can prevent catastrophic effects given a poor initial environmental
    state. Assuming that poor countries have the resources to do so, a consensus in
    that class group to defect from the strategy of the rich group (who are generally
    incentivized to continue ``business as usual'') can frequently prevent the vegetation
    proportion from converging to 0.

  title: Numerical Reconstruction of Coefficients in Elliptic Equations Using Continuous
    Data Assimilation
  authors: Peiran Zhang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.16954v1
  abstract: We consider the numerical reconstruction of the spatially dependent conductivity
    coefficient and the source term in elliptic partial differential equations of
    in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
    condition and given interior observation of the solution. Using data assimilation,
    some approximated gradients of our error functional are derived to update the
    reconstructed coefficients, and new $L^2$ error estimates for such minimization
    formulations are given for the spatially discretized reconstructions. Numerical
    examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method and demonstrate
    the error estimates. The numerical results also show that the reconstruction is
    very robust for the error in certain inputted coefficients.

  title: 'Integrating AI and Ensemble Forecasting: Explainable Materials Planning
    with Scorecards and Trend Insights for a Large-Scale Manufacturer'
  authors: Saravanan Venkatachalam
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.01006v1
  abstract: 'This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand forecasting
    and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical,
    machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven analytics layer
    for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests exogenous signals
    (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle, seasonality) and treats
    COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part forecasts with calibrated
    intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts high-revenue items individually
    and pools the long tail via clusters, while horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights
    with business-relevant losses (e.g., WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard
    delivers decision-focused insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue
    share and count, bias decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and
    product-family hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country
    pairs. A trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent
    months, flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
    aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
    factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware narratives
    and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business definitions, automate
    quality checks and reconciliations, and translate quantitative results into concise,
    explainable summaries for planners and executives. The system exposes a reproducible
    workflow -- request specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts,
    and AI-generated narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we
    now?" to "Where is accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing
    the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more
    than 90 countries and about 6,000 parts.'

  title: Probability calibration for precipitation nowcasting
  authors: Lauri Kurki, Yaniel Cabrera, Samu Karanko
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.00594v1
  abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive decision-making,
    yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts.
    Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail
    to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected
    thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration
    in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques
    from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective
    scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing
    the forecast quality.

  title: 'On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian
    trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation'
  authors: Ke Zhou, Samuel J. Grauer
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.00479v1
  abstract: We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and
    unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT
    offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental
    tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated
    by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and
    particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop
    a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with
    Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields
    and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow.
    Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability
    across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy
    tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable.
    In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5),
    we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing
    the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated
    flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density,
    and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the
    potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic
    sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes
    number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental
    design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened
    to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are
    limited.

  title: 'EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper
    scoring rules'
  authors: Maybritt Schillinger, Maxim Samarin, Xinwei Shen, Reto Knutti, Nicolai
    Meinshausen
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.26258v1
  abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation
    models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling
    to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this
    refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine
    learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs
    to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the
    full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is
    characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We
    introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full
    GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data.
    It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed
    by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ
    generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared
    to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational
    cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables
    -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent
    over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that
    enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation
    framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure,
    extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates
    EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising
    approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.

  title: 'Swift: An Autoregressive Consistency Model for Efficient Weather Forecasting'
  authors: Jason Stock, Troy Arcomano, Rao Kotamarthi
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.25631v1
  abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
    weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers during
    inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) applications
    where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential. To address
    this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for the first
    time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model with a continuous
    ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates the need for multi-model
    ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show that Swift produces skillful
    6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75 days, running $39\times$ faster
    than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while achieving forecast skill competitive
    with the numerical-based, operational IFS ENS. This marks a step toward efficient
    and reliable ensemble forecasting from medium-range to seasonal-scales.

  arxiv: 2509.25578v1
  abstract: With the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, we are firmly in the
    era of exoplanet atmosphere characterization. Understanding exoplanet spectra
    requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary
    atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary
    atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical
    and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions
    and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics,
    thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet
    WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem
    broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of
    all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur
    chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft
    missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy
    balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols
    with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular
    VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement
    for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100
    time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively
    general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged
    to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.
