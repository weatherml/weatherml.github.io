  abstract: "FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global\
    \ data-driven weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium-range\
    \ global predictions at 0.25\u25E6 resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts\
    \ high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation,\
    \ and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind\
    \ energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones,\
    \ extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting\
    \ accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art\
    \ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale\
    \ variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure,\
    \ including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less\
    \ than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet\
    \ enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with\
    \ thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting. We discuss\
    \ how data-driven deep learning models such as FourCastNet are a valuable addition\
    \ to the meteorology toolkit to aid and augment NWP models."

  abstract: We present MetNet, a neural network that forecasts precipitation up to
    8 hours into the future. The model takes a 1024 km x 1024 km area of radar and
    satellite data as input and predicts future precipitation at a resolution of 1
    km. MetNet is based on a deep convolutional neural network with self-attention
    mechanism to capture spatial context and temporal dependencies. We show that MetNet
    outperforms traditional physics-based models in terms of accuracy and skill, especially
    for short-term forecasts. MetNet is also significantly faster, generating a forecast
    in seconds compared to hours for traditional models.

  arxiv: '2212.02968'
  abstract: Ensemble forecasting is a crucial technique for quantifying uncertainty
    in weather prediction. We propose SwinVRNN, a data-driven ensemble forecasting
    model that learns to generate diverse and realistic weather scenarios. SwinVRNN
    combines a Swin Transformer with a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)
    to model the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere. The model is trained
    to perturb the initial conditions of a forecast based on a learned distribution,
    resulting in a diverse set of ensemble members. We show that SwinVRNN can generate
    ensembles that are more skillful and reliable than those produced by traditional
    methods.

  abstract: Data assimilation is the process of incorporating observations into a

    system. FengWu-4DVar uses a deep neural network to learn the model error and then
    uses this information to correct the forecast. We show that FengWu-4DVar can significantly
    improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, especially for long-range predictions.
    The model is also able to assimilate a wide range of observations, including satellite

  abstract: Downscaling is the process of increasing the resolution of a weather forecast.
    We present MambaDS, a deep learning model for downscaling near-surface meteorological
    fields. MambaDS uses a selective state-space model to capture the complex relationships
    between large-scale atmospheric circulation and local weather conditions. The
    model is constrained by high-resolution topography data to ensure that the downscaled
    fields are physically consistent. We show that MambaDS can produce high-resolution
    forecasts that are more accurate than those produced by traditional statistical
    downscaling methods.

  arxiv: '2409.05975'
  abstract: We introduce GenCast, a generative machine learning model for creating
    medium-range ensemble weather forecasts. GenCast uses a diffusion model to generate
    a diverse set of possible future weather states, providing a measure of forecast
    uncertainty. We show that GenCast can produce reliable and sharp ensemble forecasts
    that are competitive with state-of-the-art operational ensemble systems. GenCast
    represents a new paradigm for ensemble forecasting that has the potential to improve

  title: Using machine learning to downscale coarse-resolution environmental variables
    for understanding the spatial frequency of convective storms
  authors: Hungjui Yu, Lander Ver Hoef, Kristen L. Rasmussen, Imme Ebert-Uphoff
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.08802v1
  abstract: Global climate models (GCMs), typically run at ~100-km resolution, capture
    large-scale environmental conditions but cannot resolve convection and cloud processes
    at kilometer scales. Convection-permitting models offer higher-resolution simulations
    that explicitly simulate convection but are computationally expensive and impractical
    for large ensemble runs. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a bridge
    between these approaches. We train simple, pixel-based neural networks to predict
    convective storm frequency from environmental variables produced by a regional
    convection-permitting model. The ML models achieve promising results, with structural
    similarity index measure (SSIM) values exceeding 0.8, capturing the diurnal cycle
    and orographic convection without explicit temporal or spatial coordinates as
    input. Model performance declines when fewer input features are used or specific
    regions are excluded, underscoring the role of diverse physical mechanisms in
    convective activity. These findings highlight ML potential as a computationally
    efficient tool for representing convection and as a means of scientific discovery,
    offering insights into convective processes. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
    which depend on spatial structure and grid size, the pixel-based model treats
    each grid point independently, enabling value-to-value prediction without spatial
    context. This design enhances adaptability to resolution changes and supports
    generalization to unseen environmental regimes, making it particularly suited
    for linking environmental conditions to convective features and for application
    across diverse model grids or climate scenarios.

  title: Nuclear Data Adjustment for Nonlinear Applications in the OECD/NEA WPNCS
    SG14 Benchmark -- A Bayesian Inverse UQ-based Approach for Data Assimilation
  authors: Christopher Brady, Xu Wu
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.07790v1
  abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
    Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to assess
    the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to nonlinear
    applications and experiments with low correlation to applications. This work introduces
    Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a method for nuclear data
    adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the more traditional methods
    of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior
    predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications.
    When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ posterior predictions to computed model responses
    using adjusted parameters, we observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate
    computed response distributions for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows
    near agreement, and IUQ uses computed model responses directly. We also discuss
    observations on why experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative
    to nuclear data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
    for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark indicates
    potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.

  title: 'FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching
    and ODE Integration'
  authors: Shuangshuang He, Yuanting Zhang, Hongli Liang, Qingye Meng, Xingyuan Yuan
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14775v1
  abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
    Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals,
    yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge.
    This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts
    and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle.
    To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric
    state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow
    path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally
    with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine
    strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching
    and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation
    (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight
    low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by
    15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms
    strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy
    conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details.
    It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting
    extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities
    associated with assimilation cycle transitions.

  title: Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiscale Data Assimilation in Physical Domain based
    on Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System
  authors: Hyeonggeun Yun, Quanling Deng
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14586v1
  abstract: This research aims to further investigate the process of Lagrangian-Eulerian
    Multiscale Data Assimilation (LEMDA) by replacing the Fourier space with the physical
    domain. Such change in the perspective of domain introduces the advantages of
    being able to deal in non-periodic system and more intuitive representation of
    localised phenomena or time-dependent problems. The context of the domain for
    this paper was set as sea ice floe trajectories to recover the ocean eddies in
    the Arctic regions, which led the model to be derived from two-layer Quasi geostrophic
    (QG) model. The numerical solution to this model utilises the Conditional Gaussian
    Nonlinear System (CGNS) to accommodate the inherent non-linearity in analytical
    and continuous manner. The normalised root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern
    correlation (Corr) are used to evaluate the performance of the posterior mean
    of the model. The results corroborate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer
    QG model in physical domain. Nonetheless, the paper still discusses opportunities
    of improvement, such as deploying neural network (NN) to accelerate the recovery
    of local particle of Lagrangian DA for the fine scale.

  title: 'Variational data assimilation for the wave equation in heterogeneous media:
    Numerical investigation of stability'
  authors: Erik Burman, Janosch Preuss, Tim van Beeck
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.13108v1
  abstract: In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation
    problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral
    boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz
    stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising
    optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether
    these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity.
    Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe
    that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far
    more demanding than in the homogeneous case.

  abstract: 'Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system
    by exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere,
    ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm allows
    for distributed development of individual components within a common framework,
    unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via spatial or temporal
    alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach adapted for machine
    learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled global climate model
    emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at 1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly
    atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with 145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric
    and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables.
    SamudrACE is highly stable and has low climate biases comparable to those of its

    climate phenomena such as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.'

  arxiv: 2509.12147v1
  abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
    events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution
    (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While
    machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed
    climate predictions, their ability to generalize under distribution shifts remains
    a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This
    research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in
    diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to
    climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability
    across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models.
    These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide
    actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.

  title: Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models
  authors: Kevin Valencia, Ziyang Liu, Justin Cui
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.11047v1
  abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
    recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
    promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive
    and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science,
    where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we
    explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion
    models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time
    stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data
    training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs
    only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results
    demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for
    weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
    methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.
