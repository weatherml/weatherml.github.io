  abstract: "FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global\
    \ data-driven weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium-range\
    \ global predictions at 0.25\u25E6 resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts\
    \ high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation,\
    \ and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind\
    \ energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones,\
    \ extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting\
    \ accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art\
    \ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale\
    \ variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure,\
    \ including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less\
    \ than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet\
    \ enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with\
    \ thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting. We discuss\
    \ how data-driven deep learning models such as FourCastNet are a valuable addition\
    \ to the meteorology toolkit to aid and augment NWP models."

  abstract: We present MetNet, a neural network that forecasts precipitation up to
    8 hours into the future. The model takes a 1024 km x 1024 km area of radar and
    satellite data as input and predicts future precipitation at a resolution of 1
    km. MetNet is based on a deep convolutional neural network with self-attention
    mechanism to capture spatial context and temporal dependencies. We show that MetNet
    outperforms traditional physics-based models in terms of accuracy and skill, especially
    for short-term forecasts. MetNet is also significantly faster, generating a forecast
    in seconds compared to hours for traditional models.

  title: 'SwinVRNN: A Data-Driven Ensemble Forecasting Model via Learned Distribution
    Perturbation'
  authors: Yuan-Hao Lee, Chih-Yao Ma
  year: 2023
  arxiv: '2212.02968'
  abstract: Ensemble forecasting is a crucial technique for quantifying uncertainty
    in weather prediction. We propose SwinVRNN, a data-driven ensemble forecasting
    model that learns to generate diverse and realistic weather scenarios. SwinVRNN
    combines a Swin Transformer with a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)
    to model the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere. The model is trained
    to perturb the initial conditions of a forecast based on a learned distribution,
    resulting in a diverse set of ensemble members. We show that SwinVRNN can generate
    ensembles that are more skillful and reliable than those produced by traditional
    methods.

  arxiv: '2312.12455'
  abstract: Data assimilation is the process of incorporating observations into a
    numerical model to improve its initial conditions. We present FengWu-4DVar, a
    data-driven weather forecasting model that is coupled with a 4D variational assimilation
    system. FengWu-4DVar uses a deep neural network to learn the model error and then
    uses this information to correct the forecast. We show that FengWu-4DVar can significantly
    improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, especially for long-range predictions.
    The model is also able to assimilate a wide range of observations, including satellite
    data, radar data, and ground-based measurements.

  arxiv: '2408.06400'
  abstract: Downscaling is the process of increasing the resolution of a weather forecast.
    We present MambaDS, a deep learning model for downscaling near-surface meteorological
    fields. MambaDS uses a selective state-space model to capture the complex relationships
    between large-scale atmospheric circulation and local weather conditions. The
    model is constrained by high-resolution topography data to ensure that the downscaled
    fields are physically consistent. We show that MambaDS can produce high-resolution
    forecasts that are more accurate than those produced by traditional statistical
    downscaling methods.

  abstract: We describe GraphCast, a machine learning-based method for medium-range
    weather forecasting. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10
    days at 0.25 degree resolution globally. GraphCast's predictions are more accurate
    than the most accurate operational deterministic system, HRES, on 90% of 1380
    verification targets, and its forecasts can be produced in under one minute. GraphCast
    is a significant milestone in machine learning for weather forecasting and a testament
    to the power of deep learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.

  year: 2023
  arxiv: '2306.06079'
  abstract: We present NowcastNet, a deep learning model for nowcasting extreme precipitation.
    NowcastNet is based on a U-Net architecture with a novel attention mechanism that
    allows the model to focus on the most relevant features for predicting heavy rainfall.
    We show that NowcastNet can produce skillful forecasts of extreme precipitation
    up to 2 hours in advance, outperforming both traditional and other deep learning-based
    nowcasting methods. NowcastNet has the potential to improve our ability to issue
    timely warnings for flash floods and other hazards associated with extreme rainfall.

  year: 2024
  arxiv: '2409.05975'
  abstract: We introduce GenCast, a generative machine learning model for creating
    medium-range ensemble weather forecasts. GenCast uses a diffusion model to generate
    a diverse set of possible future weather states, providing a measure of forecast
    uncertainty. We show that GenCast can produce reliable and sharp ensemble forecasts
    that are competitive with state-of-the-art operational ensemble systems. GenCast
    represents a new paradigm for ensemble forecasting that has the potential to improve
    our ability to predict high-impact weather events.

  abstract: We present Pangu-Weather, a deep learning model for medium-range global
    weather forecasting. Pangu-Weather is based on a 3D U-Net architecture that processes
    weather data on a spherical grid. We show that Pangu-Weather can produce forecasts

  title: Using machine learning to downscale coarse-resolution environmental variables
    for understanding the spatial frequency of convective storms
  authors: Hungjui Yu, Lander Ver Hoef, Kristen L. Rasmussen, Imme Ebert-Uphoff
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.08802v1
  abstract: Global climate models (GCMs), typically run at ~100-km resolution, capture
    large-scale environmental conditions but cannot resolve convection and cloud processes
    at kilometer scales. Convection-permitting models offer higher-resolution simulations
    that explicitly simulate convection but are computationally expensive and impractical
    for large ensemble runs. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a bridge
    between these approaches. We train simple, pixel-based neural networks to predict
    convective storm frequency from environmental variables produced by a regional
    convection-permitting model. The ML models achieve promising results, with structural
    similarity index measure (SSIM) values exceeding 0.8, capturing the diurnal cycle
    and orographic convection without explicit temporal or spatial coordinates as
    input. Model performance declines when fewer input features are used or specific
    regions are excluded, underscoring the role of diverse physical mechanisms in
    convective activity. These findings highlight ML potential as a computationally
    efficient tool for representing convection and as a means of scientific discovery,
    offering insights into convective processes. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
    which depend on spatial structure and grid size, the pixel-based model treats
    each grid point independently, enabling value-to-value prediction without spatial
    context. This design enhances adaptability to resolution changes and supports
    generalization to unseen environmental regimes, making it particularly suited
    for linking environmental conditions to convective features and for application
    across diverse model grids or climate scenarios.

  title: Nuclear Data Adjustment for Nonlinear Applications in the OECD/NEA WPNCS
    SG14 Benchmark -- A Bayesian Inverse UQ-based Approach for Data Assimilation
  authors: Christopher Brady, Xu Wu
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.07790v1
  abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
    Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to assess
    the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to nonlinear
    applications and experiments with low correlation to applications. This work introduces
    Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a method for nuclear data
    adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the more traditional methods
    of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior
    predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications.
    When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ posterior predictions to computed model responses
    using adjusted parameters, we observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate
    computed response distributions for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows
    near agreement, and IUQ uses computed model responses directly. We also discuss
    observations on why experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative
    to nuclear data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
    for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark indicates
    potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.
