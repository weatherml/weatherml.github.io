  abstract: "FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global\

    \ global predictions at 0.25\u25E6 resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts\
    \ high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation,\
    \ and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind\
    \ energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones,\
    \ extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting\
    \ accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art\
    \ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale\
    \ variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure,\
    \ including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less\
    \ than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet\
    \ enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with\

  abstract: Ensemble forecasting is a crucial technique for quantifying uncertainty
    in weather prediction. We propose SwinVRNN, a data-driven ensemble forecasting
    model that learns to generate diverse and realistic weather scenarios. SwinVRNN
    combines a Swin Transformer with a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)
    to model the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere. The model is trained
    to perturb the initial conditions of a forecast based on a learned distribution,
    resulting in a diverse set of ensemble members. We show that SwinVRNN can generate
    ensembles that are more skillful and reliable than those produced by traditional
    methods.

  title: Using machine learning to downscale coarse-resolution environmental variables
    for understanding the spatial frequency of convective storms
  authors: Hungjui Yu, Lander Ver Hoef, Kristen L. Rasmussen, Imme Ebert-Uphoff
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.08802v1
  abstract: Global climate models (GCMs), typically run at ~100-km resolution, capture
    large-scale environmental conditions but cannot resolve convection and cloud processes
    at kilometer scales. Convection-permitting models offer higher-resolution simulations
    that explicitly simulate convection but are computationally expensive and impractical
    for large ensemble runs. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a bridge
    between these approaches. We train simple, pixel-based neural networks to predict
    convective storm frequency from environmental variables produced by a regional
    convection-permitting model. The ML models achieve promising results, with structural
    similarity index measure (SSIM) values exceeding 0.8, capturing the diurnal cycle
    and orographic convection without explicit temporal or spatial coordinates as
    input. Model performance declines when fewer input features are used or specific
    regions are excluded, underscoring the role of diverse physical mechanisms in
    convective activity. These findings highlight ML potential as a computationally
    efficient tool for representing convection and as a means of scientific discovery,
    offering insights into convective processes. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
    which depend on spatial structure and grid size, the pixel-based model treats
    each grid point independently, enabling value-to-value prediction without spatial
    context. This design enhances adaptability to resolution changes and supports
    generalization to unseen environmental regimes, making it particularly suited
    for linking environmental conditions to convective features and for application
    across diverse model grids or climate scenarios.

  title: Nuclear Data Adjustment for Nonlinear Applications in the OECD/NEA WPNCS
    SG14 Benchmark -- A Bayesian Inverse UQ-based Approach for Data Assimilation
  authors: Christopher Brady, Xu Wu
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.07790v1
  abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
    Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to assess
    the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to nonlinear
    applications and experiments with low correlation to applications. This work introduces
    Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a method for nuclear data
    adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the more traditional methods
    of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior
    predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications.
    When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ posterior predictions to computed model responses
    using adjusted parameters, we observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate
    computed response distributions for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows
    near agreement, and IUQ uses computed model responses directly. We also discuss
    observations on why experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative
    to nuclear data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
    for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark indicates
    potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.

  title: 'FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching
    and ODE Integration'
  authors: Shuangshuang He, Yuanting Zhang, Hongli Liang, Qingye Meng, Xingyuan Yuan
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14775v1
  abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
    Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals,
    yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge.
    This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts
    and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle.
    To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric
    state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow
    path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally
    with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine
    strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching
    and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation
    (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight
    low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by
    15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms
    strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy
    conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details.
    It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting
    extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities
    associated with assimilation cycle transitions.

  title: Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiscale Data Assimilation in Physical Domain based
    on Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System
  authors: Hyeonggeun Yun, Quanling Deng
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.14586v1
  abstract: This research aims to further investigate the process of Lagrangian-Eulerian
    Multiscale Data Assimilation (LEMDA) by replacing the Fourier space with the physical
    domain. Such change in the perspective of domain introduces the advantages of
    being able to deal in non-periodic system and more intuitive representation of
    localised phenomena or time-dependent problems. The context of the domain for
    this paper was set as sea ice floe trajectories to recover the ocean eddies in
    the Arctic regions, which led the model to be derived from two-layer Quasi geostrophic
    (QG) model. The numerical solution to this model utilises the Conditional Gaussian
    Nonlinear System (CGNS) to accommodate the inherent non-linearity in analytical
    and continuous manner. The normalised root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern
    correlation (Corr) are used to evaluate the performance of the posterior mean
    of the model. The results corroborate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer
    QG model in physical domain. Nonetheless, the paper still discusses opportunities
    of improvement, such as deploying neural network (NN) to accelerate the recovery
    of local particle of Lagrangian DA for the fine scale.

    Numerical investigation of stability'
  authors: Erik Burman, Janosch Preuss, Tim van Beeck
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.13108v1
  abstract: In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation
    problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral
    boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz
    stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising
    optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether
    these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity.
    Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe
    that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far
    more demanding than in the homogeneous case.

  abstract: 'Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system

  abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
    events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution
    (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While
    machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed

    a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This
    research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in
    diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to
    climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability
    across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models.
    These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide
    actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.

  title: Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models
  authors: Kevin Valencia, Ziyang Liu, Justin Cui
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.11047v1
  abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
    recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
    promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive
    and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science,
    where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we
    explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion
    models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time
    stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data
    training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs
    only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results
    demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for
    weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
    methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

  title: Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global
    Weather Forecasting
  authors: Zinan Zheng, Yang Liu, Jia Li
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.20911v1
  abstract: 'Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting,
    which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme
    weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for
    training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability
    to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting
    that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring
    the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we
    propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular
    weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially
    irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2)
    leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance
    spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation
    dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models.
    Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable

    solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using
    a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work
    demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification
    capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov

  title: Physics-Informed Field Inversion for Sparse Data Assimilation
  authors: Levent Ugur, Beckett Y. Zhou
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.19160v1
  abstract: Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering applications,
    given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these approaches,
    such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting low-fidelity
    models by leveraging available observations of the problem. However, the solely
    data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally requires dense observations
    that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study, we propose a physical loss
    term addition to the field inversion stage of the FIML technique similar to the
    physics-informed machine learning applications. This addition embeds the complex
    physics of the problem into the low-fidelity model, which allows for obtaining
    dense gradient information for every correction parameter and acts as an adaptive
    regularization term improving inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed
    Field Inversion approach is tested using three different examples and highlights
    that incorporating physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for
    limited data cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally,
    this modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter
    distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase
    in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an acceptable
    level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.

  title: Comparing Data Assimilation and Likelihood-Based Inference on Latent State
    Estimation in Agent-Based Models
  authors: Blas Kolic, Corrado Monti, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Marco Pangallo
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.17625v1
  abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation
    (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models
    (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent
    microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world
    data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based
    models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs
    poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation
    of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates
    the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially
    less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly
    leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,
    model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive.
    We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion
    dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar
    opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under
    model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the
    aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive
    across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest
    that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for
    agent-level inference.

  arxiv: 2509.17252v1
  abstract: Understanding the role of human behavior in shaping environmental outcomes
    is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change. Environmental
    systems are influenced not only by natural factors like temperature, but also
    by human decisions regarding mitigation efforts, which are often based on forecasts
    or predictions about future environmental conditions. Over time, different outcomes
    can emerge, including scenarios where the environment deteriorates despite efforts
    to mitigate, or where successful mitigation leads to environmental resilience.
    Additionally, fluctuations in the level of human participation in mitigation can
    occur, reflecting shifts in collective behavior. In this study, we consider a
    variety of human mitigation decisions, in addition to the feedback loop that is
    created by changes in human behavior because of environmental changes. While these
    outcomes are based on simplified models, they offer important insights into the
    dynamics of human decision-making and the factors that influence effective action
    in the context of environmental sustainability. This study aims to examine key
    social dynamics influencing society's response to a worsening climate. While others
    conclude that homophily prompts greater warming unconditionally, this model finds
    that homophily can prevent catastrophic effects given a poor initial environmental
    state. Assuming that poor countries have the resources to do so, a consensus in
    that class group to defect from the strategy of the rich group (who are generally
    incentivized to continue ``business as usual'') can frequently prevent the vegetation
    proportion from converging to 0.

  title: Numerical Reconstruction of Coefficients in Elliptic Equations Using Continuous
    Data Assimilation
  authors: Peiran Zhang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.16954v1
  abstract: We consider the numerical reconstruction of the spatially dependent conductivity
    coefficient and the source term in elliptic partial differential equations of
    in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
    condition and given interior observation of the solution. Using data assimilation,
    some approximated gradients of our error functional are derived to update the
    reconstructed coefficients, and new $L^2$ error estimates for such minimization
    formulations are given for the spatially discretized reconstructions. Numerical
    examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method and demonstrate
    the error estimates. The numerical results also show that the reconstruction is
    very robust for the error in certain inputted coefficients.

  title: 'Integrating AI and Ensemble Forecasting: Explainable Materials Planning
    with Scorecards and Trend Insights for a Large-Scale Manufacturer'
  authors: Saravanan Venkatachalam
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.01006v1
  abstract: 'This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand forecasting
    and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical,
    machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven analytics layer
    for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests exogenous signals
    (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle, seasonality) and treats
    COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part forecasts with calibrated
    intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts high-revenue items individually
    and pools the long tail via clusters, while horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights
    with business-relevant losses (e.g., WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard
    delivers decision-focused insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue
    share and count, bias decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and
    product-family hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country
    pairs. A trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent
    months, flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
    aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
    factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware narratives
    and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business definitions, automate
    quality checks and reconciliations, and translate quantitative results into concise,
    explainable summaries for planners and executives. The system exposes a reproducible
    workflow -- request specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts,
    and AI-generated narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we
    now?" to "Where is accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing
    the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more
    than 90 countries and about 6,000 parts.'

  title: Probability calibration for precipitation nowcasting
  authors: Lauri Kurki, Yaniel Cabrera, Samu Karanko
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.00594v1
  abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive decision-making,
    yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts.
    Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail
    to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected
    thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration
    in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques
    from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective
    scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing
    the forecast quality.

  title: 'On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian
    trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation'
  authors: Ke Zhou, Samuel J. Grauer
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.00479v1
  abstract: We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and
    unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT
    offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental
    tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated
    by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and
    particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop
    a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with
    Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields
    and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow.
    Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability
    across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy
    tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable.
    In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5),
    we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing
    the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated
    flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density,
    and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the
    potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic
    sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes
    number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental
    design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened
    to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are
    limited.

    scoring rules'
  authors: Maybritt Schillinger, Maxim Samarin, Xinwei Shen, Reto Knutti, Nicolai
    Meinshausen
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.26258v1
  abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation
    models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling
    to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this
    refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine
    learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs
    to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the
    full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is
    characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We
    introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full
    GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data.
    It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed
    by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ
    generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared
    to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational
    cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables
    -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent
    over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that
    enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation
    framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure,
    extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates
    EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising
    approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.

  title: 'Swift: An Autoregressive Consistency Model for Efficient Weather Forecasting'
  authors: Jason Stock, Troy Arcomano, Rao Kotamarthi
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.25631v1
  abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
    weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers during
    inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) applications
    where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential. To address
    this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for the first
    time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model with a continuous
    ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates the need for multi-model
    ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show that Swift produces skillful
    6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75 days, running $39\times$ faster
    than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while achieving forecast skill competitive
    with the numerical-based, operational IFS ENS. This marks a step toward efficient
    and reliable ensemble forecasting from medium-range to seasonal-scales.

  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2509.25578v1
  abstract: With the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, we are firmly in the
    era of exoplanet atmosphere characterization. Understanding exoplanet spectra
    requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary
    atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary
    atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical
    and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions
    and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics,
    thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet
    WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem
    broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of
    all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur
    chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft
    missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy
    balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols
    with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular
    VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement
    for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100
    time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively
    general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged
    to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.

  title: 'Beyond the Training Data: Confidence-Guided Mixing of Parameterizations
    in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model'
  authors: Helge Heuer, Tom Beucler, Mierk Schwabe, Julien Savre, Manuel Schlund,
    Veronika Eyring
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.08107v1
  abstract: Persistent systematic errors in Earth system models (ESMs) arise from
    difficulties in representing the full diversity of subgrid, multiscale atmospheric
    convection and turbulence. Machine learning (ML) parameterizations trained on
    short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce these errors.
    However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid (physics + ML) ESMs
    remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline often destabilize online
    runs. Training convection parameterizations directly on coarse-grained data is
    challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly separated. This issue is
    mitigated using data from superparameterized simulations, which provide clearer
    scale separation. Yet, transferring a parameterization from one ESM to another
    remains difficult due to distribution shifts that induce large inference errors.
    Here, we present a proof-of-concept where a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed
    NN convection parameterization is successfully transferred to ICON-A. The scheme
    is (a) trained on adjusted ClimSim data with subtracted radiative tendencies,
    and (b) integrated into ICON-A. The NN parameterization predicts its own error,
    enabling mixing with a conventional convection scheme when confidence is low,
    thus making the hybrid AI-physics model tunable with respect to observations and
    reanalysis through mixing parameters. This improves process understanding by constraining
    convective tendencies across column water vapor, lower-tropospheric stability,
    and geographical conditions, yielding interpretable regime behavior. In AMIP-style
    setups, several hybrid configurations outperform the default convection scheme
    (e.g., improved precipitation statistics). With additive input noise during training,
    both hybrid and pure-ML schemes lead to stable simulations and remain physically
    consistent for at least 20 years.

    Xiang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.07953v1
  abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
    observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent complexity
    of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for addressing
    various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture, transportation,
    and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing non-autoregressive nowcasting
    approaches, we investigate the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models
    and propose SimCast, a novel training pipeline featuring a short-to-long term
    knowledge distillation technique coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize
    heavy rainfall regions. Improved nowcasting predictions can be obtained without
    introducing additional overhead during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic
    predictions, we further integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast,
    leveraging the strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such
    as blurriness and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental
    results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
    framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361
    on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.

  arxiv: 2510.06637v1
  abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
    models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored.
    We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight
    controller network, trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning
    stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost
    objective. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA)
    for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), a setting where
    existing methods are often computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift
    under sparse observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward
    rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
    optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
    four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity
    across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We will release code and
    checkpoints publicly.

  abstract: 'The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network
    of roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
    observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on roads
    and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary for
    making critical operational decisions during winter weather events. However, machine
    learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT by automatically
    classifying current road conditions across the state. In this study, convolutional
    neural networks and random forests are trained on camera images and weather data
    to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained on a hand-labeled dataset
    of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human labelers into one of six road
    surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, or obstructed.
    Model generalizability is prioritized to meet the operational needs of the NYSDOT
    decision makers, and the weather-related road surface condition model in this
    study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on completely unseen cameras.'

  title: Structurally informed data assimilation in two dimensions
  authors: Tongtong Li, Anne Gelb, Yoonsang Lee
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.06369v1
  abstract: Accurate data assimilation (DA) for systems with piecewise-smooth or discontinuous
    state variables remains a significant challenge, as conventional covariance-based
    ensemble Kalman filter approaches often fail to effectively balance observations
    and model information near sharp features. In this paper we develop a structurally
    informed DA framework using ensemble transform Kalman filtering (ETKF). Our approach
    introduces gradient-based weighting matrices constructed from finite difference
    statistics of the forecast ensemble, thereby allowing the assimilation process
    to dynamically adjust the influence of observations and prior estimates according
    to local roughness. The design is intentionally flexible so that it can be suitably
    refined for sparse data environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
    new structurally informed data assimilation framework consistently yields greater
    accuracy when compared to more conventional approaches.

  authors: Jordan Seneca, Suzanne Bintanja, Frank M. Selten
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.06180v1
  abstract: In climate science, the tuning of climate models is a computationally
    intensive problem due to the combination of the high-dimensionality of the system
    state and long integration times. Here we demonstrate the potential of a parameter
    estimation algorithm which makes use of synchronization to tune a global atmospheric
    model at modest computational costs. We first use it to directly optimize internal
    model parameters. We then apply the algorithm to the weights of each member of
    a supermodel ensemble to optimize the overall predictions. In both cases, the
    algorithm is able to find parameters which result in reduced errors in the climatology
    of the model. Finally, we introduce a novel approach which combines both methods
    called adaptive supermodeling, where the internal parameters of the members of
    a supermodel are tuned simultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel
    predictions are optimized. For a case designed to challenge the two previous methods,
    adaptive supermodeling achieves a performance similar to a perfect model.

  authors: Hang Fan, Yi Xiao, Yongquan Qu, Fenghua Ling, Ben Fei, Lei Bai, Pierre
    Gentine
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.04006v1
  abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in
    surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting, leading
    to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most ML-based
    forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific
    loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long
    time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout
    training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint
    four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis
    data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis
    error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute
    the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis
    error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly
    model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with
    latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves
    fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space
    loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources,
    enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source
    observations within a unified theoretical formulation.

  authors: Thao Nguyen, Jiaqi Ma, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Souhaib Ben Taieb, Salman Khan
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.14962v1
  abstract: 'Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from
    current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently
    chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While
    recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale
    motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
    issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding
    complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally
    intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model
    long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose
    a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but
    also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial
    interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively
    integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource
    cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate
    latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse
    datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
    approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in

  abstract: 'Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
    remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather simulations.
    An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a faster alternative
    for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still in question, as they
    are often evaluated using standard machine learning metrics rather than insights
    from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper benchmarks recent state-of-the-art
    deep learning models and introduces physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their
    performance and reliability, with a particular focus on geographic generalization
    and physical consistency. Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong
    performance of models such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European
    geographies (e.g., central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions
    such as Iberia, Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail
    to accurately capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity
    derived from predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
    geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent predictions.
    We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral density loss
    function that empirically improves geographic generalization by encouraging the
    reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for reproducing the
    experimental results can be found at https://github.com/CarloSaccardi/PSD-Downscaling'

    F. Siegel
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.13425v1
  abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are critical for understanding past climates
    and projecting future scenarios. However, the complexity of these models, which
    include large code bases, a wide community of developers, and diverse computational
    platforms, poses significant challenges for software quality assurance. The increasing
    adoption of GPUs and heterogeneous architectures further complicates verification
    efforts. Traditional verification methods often rely on bitwise reproducibility,
    which is not always feasible, particularly under new compilers or hardware. Manual
    expert evaluation, on the other hand, is subjective and time-consuming. Formal
    methods offer a mathematically rigorous alternative, yet their application in
    ESM development has been limited due to the lack of climate model-specific representations
    and tools. Here, we advocate for the broader adoption of formal methods in climate
    modeling. In particular, we identify key aspects of ESMs that are well suited
    to formal specification and introduce abstraction approaches for a tailored framework.
    To demonstrate this approach, we present a case study using CIVL model checker
    to formally verify a bug fix in an ocean mixing parameterization scheme. Our goal
    is to develop accessible, domain-specific formal tools that enhance model confidence
    and support more efficient and reliable ESM development.

  title: Km-scale dynamical downscaling through conformalized latent diffusion models
  authors: Alessandro Brusaferri, Andrea Ballarino
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.13301v1
  abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
    fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
    applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative
    Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for
    this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting
    uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against
    overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty
    estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we
    tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction
    framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional
    quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure
    targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity.
    The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
    to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
    markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
    baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more
    trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.

    is on the order of 1E4 to 1E9 cm2 s-1 and a turbopause is at altitudes of 70 to
    140 km, varying with seasons. The triggered mixing has minor effects on model
    temperatures, yet it substantially impacts upper atmospheric abundances. Simulations
    are consistent with observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and the Neutral
    Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer. Mixing enhances the tracer transports in the middle
    and upper atmosphere, governing the dynamics of these regions. The scheme reveals
    how non-orographic GW-induced turbulence can regulate upper atmospheric processes,
    such as tracer escape.

  title: 'IEnSF: Iterative Ensemble Score Filter for Reducing Error in Posterior Score
    Estimation in Nonlinear Data Assimilation'
  authors: Zezhong Zhang, Feng Bao, Guannan Zhang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.20159v1
  abstract: The Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) has emerged as a promising approach to
    leverage score-based diffusion models for solving high-dimensional and nonlinear
    data assimilation problems. While initial applications of EnSF to the Lorenz-96
    model and the quasi-geostrophic system showed potential, the current method employs
    a heuristic weighted sum to combine the prior and the likelihood score functions.
    This introduces a structural error into the estimation of the posterior score
    function in the nonlinear setting. This work addresses this challenge by developing
    an iterative ensemble score filter (IEnSF) that applies an iterative algorithm
    as an outer loop around the reverse-time stochastic differential equation solver.
    When the state dynamics or the observation operator is nonlinear, the iterative
    algorithm can gradually reduce the posterior score estimation error by improving
    the accuracy of approximating the conditional expectation of the likelihood score
    function. The number of iterations required depends on the distance between the
    prior and posterior distributions and the nonlinearity of the observation operator.
    Numerical experiments demonstrate that the IEnSF algorithm substantially reduces
    the error in posterior score estimation in the nonlinear setting and thus improves
    the accuracy of tracking high-dimensional dynamical systems.

  title: Non-intrusive structural-preserving sequential data assimilation
  authors: Lizuo Liu, Tongtong Li, Anne Gelb
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.19701v1
  abstract: Data assimilation (DA) methods combine model predictions with observational
    data to improve state estimation in dynamical systems, inspiring their increasingly
    prominent role in geophysical and climate applications. Classical DA methods assume
    that the governing equations modeling the dynamics are known, which is unlikely
    for most real world applications. Machine learning (ML) provides a flexible alternative
    by learning surrogate models directly from data, but standard ML methods struggle
    in noisy and data-scarce environments, where meaningful extrapolation requires
    incorporating physical constraints. Recent advances in structure-preserving ML
    architectures, such as the development of the entropy-stable conservative flux
    form network (ESCFN), highlight the critical role of physical structure in improving
    learning stability and accuracy for unknown systems of conservation laws. Structural
    information has also been shown to improve DA performance. Gradient-based measures
    of spatial variability, in particular, can help refine ensemble updates in discontinuous
    systems. Motivated by both of these recent innovations, this investigation proposes
    a new non-intrusive, structure-preserving sequential data assimilation (NSSDA)
    framework that leverages structure at both the forecast and analysis stages. We
    use the ESCFN to construct a surrogate model to preserve physical laws during
    forecasting, and a structurally informed ensemble transform Kalman filter (SETKF)
    to embed local statistical structure into the assimilation step. Our method operates
    in a highly constrained environment, using only a single noisy trajectory for
    both training and assimilation. Numerical experiments where the unknown dynamics
    correspond respectively to the shallow water and Euler equations demonstrate significantly
    improved predictive accuracy.

  title: 'OmniCast: A Masked Latent Diffusion Model for Weather Forecasting Across
    Time Scales'
  authors: Tung Nguyen, Tuan Pham, Troy Arcomano, Veerabhadra Kotamarthi, Ian Foster,
    Sandeep Madireddy, Aditya Grover
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.18707v1
  abstract: 'Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
    and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
    on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but struggle
    at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error accumulation in
    their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose OmniCast, a scalable and
    skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather forecasting across timescales.
    OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model that encodes raw weather data
    into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent space, and a diffusion-based transformer
    model that generates a sequence of future latent tokens given the initial conditioning
    tokens. During training, we mask random future tokens and train the transformer
    to estimate their distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token
    diffusion head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence
    of future tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint
    sampling across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
    approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
    future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
    initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
    methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and achieves
    state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale across accuracy,
    physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OmniCast
    can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead. Code and model checkpoints
    are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/omnicast.'

  title: Uncertainty-aware data assimilation through variational inference
  authors: Anthony Frion, David S Greenberg
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.17268v1
  abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model
    with a set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of
    a system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an existing
    deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational inference-based
    extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
    Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing ground, we show that our new
    model enables to obtain nearly perfectly calibrated predictions, and can be integrated
    in a wider variational data assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater
    benefit from increasing lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available

    postprocessing'
  authors: "Maurits Flos, Bastien Fran\xE7ois, Irene Schicker, Kirien Whan, Elisa\
    \ Perrone"
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.25610v1
  abstract: 'Weather predictions are often provided as ensembles generated by repeated
    runs of numerical weather prediction models. These forecasts typically exhibit
    bias and inaccurate dependence structures due to numerical and dispersion errors,
    requiring statistical postprocessing for improved precision. A common correction
    strategy is the two-step approach: first adjusting the univariate forecasts, then
    reconstructing the multivariate dependence. The second step is usually handled
    with nonparametric methods, which can underperform when historical data are limited.
    Parametric alternatives, such as the Gaussian Copula Approach (GCA), offer theoretical
    advantages but often produce poorly calibrated multivariate forecasts due to random
    sampling of the corrected univariate margins. In this work, we introduce COBASE,
    a novel copula-based postprocessing framework that preserves the flexibility of
    parametric modeling while mimicking the nonparametric techniques through a rank-shuffling
    mechanism. This design ensures calibrated margins and realistic dependence reconstruction.
    We evaluate COBASE on multi-site 2-meter temperature forecasts from the ALADIN-LAEF
    ensemble over Austria and on joint forecasts of temperature and dew point temperature
    from the ECMWF system in the Netherlands. Across all regions, COBASE variants
    consistently outperform traditional copula-based approaches, such as GCA, and
    achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art nonparametric methods like SimSchaake
    and ECC, with only minimal differences across settings. These results position
    COBASE as a competitive and robust alternative for multivariate ensemble postprocessing,
    offering a principled bridge between parametric and nonparametric dependence reconstruction.'

  title: Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation for PDEs with Sparse Observations
  authors: Tong Wu, Humberto Godinez, Vitaliy Gyrya, James M. Hyman
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.24944v1
  abstract: Sparse sensor networks in weather and ocean modeling observe only a small
    fraction of the system state, which destabilizes standard nudging-based data assimilation.
    We introduce Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation (IDDA), which modifies
    how discrepancies enter the governing equations. Rather than adding observations
    as a forcing term alone, IDDA also adjusts the nonlinear operator using interpolated
    observational information. This structural change suppresses error amplification
    when nonlinear effects dominate. We prove exponential convergence under explicit
    conditions linking error decay to observation spacing, nudging strength, and diffusion
    coefficient. The key requirement establishes bounds on nudging strength relative
    to observation spacing and diffusion, giving practitioners a clear operating window.
    When observations resolve the relevant scales, error decays at a user-specified
    rate. Critically, the error bound scales with the square of observation spacing
    rather than through hard-to-estimate nonlinear growth rates. We validate IDDA
    on Burgers flow, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics, and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
    turbulence. Across these tests, IDDA reaches target accuracy faster than standard
    interpolated nudging, remains stable in chaotic regimes, avoids non-monotone transients,
    and requires minimal parameter tuning. Because IDDA uses standard explicit time
    integration, it fits readily into existing simulation pipelines without specialized
    solvers. These properties make IDDA a practical upgrade for operational systems
    constrained by sparse sensor coverage.

  title: High-Quality and Large-Scale Image Downscaling for Modern Display Devices
  authors: Suvrojit Mitra, G B Kevin Arjun, Sanjay Ghosh
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.24334v1
  abstract: 'In modern display technology and visualization tools, downscaling images
    is one of the most important activities. This procedure aims to maintain both
    visual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of
    an image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this
    study, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses co-occurrence
    learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while reducing resolution.
    The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven co-occurrence profile
    that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in nearby neighborhoods.
    A refined filtering process is guided by this profile, which acts as a content-adaptive
    range kernel. The contribution of each input pixel is based on how closely it
    resembles pair-wise intensity values with it''s neighbors. We validate our proposed
    technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100, Urban100, and RealSR to show its effective
    downscaling capacity. Our technique could obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K
    dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on the same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x,
    respectively. Numerous experimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested
    picture downscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms
    of both visual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods,
    which did not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve high-quality
    downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our method, LSID (large
    scale image downscaling), successfully preserves high-frequency structures like
    edges, textures, and repeating patterns by focusing on statistically consistent
    pixels while reducing aliasing and blurring artifacts that are typical of traditional
    downscaling techniques.'

  title: A PDE-Informed Latent Diffusion Model for 2-m Temperature Downscaling
  authors: Paul Rosu, Muchang Bahng, Erick Jiang, Rico Zhu, Vahid Tarokh
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.23866v1
  abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored
    for dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
    high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
    architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
    integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's training
    objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel) space by decoding
    the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical consistency through
    a finite-difference approximation of an effective advection-diffusion balance.
    Empirical observations indicate that conventional diffusion training already yields
    low PDE residuals, and we investigate how fine-tuning with this additional loss
    further regularizes the model and enhances the physical plausibility of the generated
    fields. The entirety of our codebase is available on Github, for future reference
    and development.

  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.23794v1
  abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
    weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
    traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited capability
    to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a learnable perturbation
    scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel AI-based forecasting paradigm.
    Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs
    in 2018, examining their performance in TC-related physical variables, track and
    intensity forecasts, and the associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields.
    FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables,
    and achieves more accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though
    it still underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical
    and thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
    circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around the
    TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution. These
    findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC forecasting
    skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble prediction
    of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

    Zhang, Wanghan Xu, Li Yan, Pierre Gentine, Lei Bai
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.22562v1
  abstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in numerical weather prediction
    by systematically integrating sparse observations with model forecasts to estimate
    optimal atmospheric initial condition for forthcoming forecasts. Traditional Bayesian
    DA methods adopt a Gaussian background prior as a practical compromise for the
    curse of dimensionality in atmospheric systems, that simplifies the nonlinear
    nature of atmospheric dynamics and can result in biased estimates. To address
    this limitation, we propose a novel generative DA method, LO-SDA. First, a variational
    autoencoder is trained to learn compact latent representations that disentangle
    complex atmospheric correlations. Within this latent space, a background-conditioned
    diffusion model is employed to directly learn the conditional distribution from
    data, thereby generalizing and removing assumptions in the Gaussian prior in traditional
    DA methods. Most importantly, we introduce latent optimization during the reverse
    process of the diffusion model to ensure strict consistency between the generated
    states and sparse observations. Idealized experiments demonstrate that LO-SDA
    not only outperforms score-based DA methods based on diffusion posterior sampling
    but also surpasses traditional DA approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first
    time that a diffusion-based DA method demonstrates the potential to outperform
    traditional approaches on high-dimensional global atmospheric systems. These findings
    suggest that long-standing reliance on Gaussian priors-a foundational assumption
    in operational atmospheric DA-may no longer be necessary in light of advances
    in generative modeling.

  title: Structure Aware Image Downscaling
  authors: G B Kevin Arjun, Suvrojit Mitra, Sanjay Ghosh
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2510.22551v1
  abstract: 'Image downscaling is one of the key operations in recent display technology
    and visualization tools. By this process, the dimension of an image is reduced,
    aiming to preserve structural integrity and visual fidelity. In this paper, we
    propose a new image downscaling method which is built on the core ideas of image
    filtering and edge detection. In particular, we present a structure-informed downscaling
    algorithm that maintains fine details through edge-aware processing. The proposed
    method comprises three steps: (i) edge map computation, (ii) edge-guided interpolation,
    and (iii) texture enhancement. To faithfully retain the strong structures in an
    image, we first compute the edge maps by applying an efficient edge detection
    operator. This is followed by an edge-guided interpolation to preserve fine details
    after resizing. Finally, we fuse local texture enriched component of the original
    image to the interpolated one to restore high-frequency information. By integrating
    edge information with adaptive filtering, our approach effectively minimizes artifacts
    while retaining crucial image features. To demonstrate the effective downscaling
    capability of our proposed method, we validate on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100,
    Urban100, and RealSR. For downscaling by 4x, our method could achieve as high
    as 39.07 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and 38.71 dB on the RealSR dataset. Extensive
    experimental results confirm that the proposed image downscaling method is capable
    of achieving superior performance in terms of both visual quality and performance
    metrics with reference to recent methods. Most importantly, the downscaled images
    by our method do not suffer from edge blurring and texture loss, unlike many existing

  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.04659v1
  abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity
    and extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
    Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
    rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
    suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
    methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction
    of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully three-dimensional
    nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar reflectivity and
    couples physically constrained neural operators with datadriven learning. The
    model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields under a conservative advection
    operator, parameterizes spatially varying diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired
    stochastic term to represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale
    convective initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
    module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
    to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
    of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D dynamics
    with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for skillful
    and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

  abstract: 'Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied

    an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates Vision Transformer (ViT),
    Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and Geospatial Spatiotemporal

    Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected
    during the 1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations
    of day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed
    improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2: 0.92),
    allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the SSP5-8.5

  abstract: Understanding regional hydroclimatic variability and its drivers is essential
    for anticipating the impacts of climate change on water resources and sustainability.
    Yet, considerable uncertainty remains in the simulation of the coupled land atmosphere
    water and energy cycles, largely due to structural model limitations, simplified
    process representations, and insufficient spatial resolution. Within the framework
    of the Collaborative Research Center 1502 DETECT, this study presents a coordinated
    intercomparison of regional climate model simulations designed for water cycle
    process analysis over Europe. We analyze the performance of simulations using
    the ICON and TSMP1 model systems and covering the period from 1990 to 2020, comparing
    against reference datasets (E-OBS, GPCC, and GLEAM). We focus on 2 m air temperature,
    precipitation and evapotranspiration over four representative basins, the Ebro,
    Po, Rhine, and Tisa, within the EURO CORDEX domain.   Our analysis reveals systematic
    cold biases across all basins and seasons, with ICON generally outperforming TSMP1.
    Precipitation biases exhibit substantial spread, particularly in summer, reflecting
    the persistent challenge of accurately simulating precipitation. ICON tends to
    underestimate evapotranspiration, while TSMP1 performs better some seasons. Sensitivity
    experiments further indicate that the inclusion of irrigation improves simulation
    performance in the Po basin, which is intensively irrigated, and that higher-resolution
    sea surface temperature forcing data improves the overall precipitation representation.
    This baseline evaluation provides a first assessment of the DETECT multimodel
    ensemble and highlights key structural differences influencing model skill across

  title: Reinforcement learning based data assimilation for unknown state model
  authors: Ziyi Wang, Lijian Jiang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.02286v1
  abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for
    state estimation   across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging
    when the governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
    various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
    state transition   model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
    training   datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
    state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method
    that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian ffltering
    methods, enabling   the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown
    dynamics directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
    Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
    of surrogate model parameters   as a sequential decision-making problem, which
    can be formulated as a discretetime   Markov decision process (MDP). Under this
    formulation, learning the surrogate transition model is equivalent to ffnding
    an optimal policy of the MDP, which can be effectively addressed using reinforcement
    learning techniques. Once the model is trained offfine, state estimation can be
    performed in the online stage using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics.
    The proposed framework accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including
    nonlinear and partially observed measurement   models. A few numerical examples
    demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and robustness
    in high-dimensional settings.

  title: Learned Adaptive Kernels for High-Fidelity Image Downscaling
  authors: Piyush Narhari Pise, Sanjay Ghosh
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.01620v1
  abstract: Image downscaling is a fundamental operation in image processing, crucial
    for adapting high-resolution content to various display and storage constraints.
    While classic methods often introduce blurring or aliasing, recent learning-based
    approaches offer improved adaptivity. However, achieving maximal fidelity against
    ground-truth low-resolution (LR) images, particularly by accounting for channel-specific
    characteristics, remains an open challenge. This paper introduces ADK-Net (Adaptive
    Downscaling Kernel Network), a novel deep convolutional neural network framework
    for high-fidelity supervised image downscaling. ADK-Net explicitly addresses channel
    interdependencies by learning to predict spatially-varying, adaptive resampling
    kernels independently for each pixel and uniquely for each color channel (RGB).
    The architecture employs a hierarchical design featuring a ResNet-based feature
    extractor and parallel channel-specific kernel generators, themselves composed
    of ResNet-based trunk and branch sub-modules, enabling fine-grained kernel prediction.
    Trained end-to-end using an L1 reconstruction loss against ground-truth LR data,

  title: 'DAMBench: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Deep Learning-based Atmospheric Data
    Assimilation'
  authors: Hao Wang, Zixuan Weng, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Hao Liu
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.01468v1
  abstract: 'Data Assimilation is a cornerstone of atmospheric system modeling, tasked
    with reconstructing system states by integrating sparse, noisy observations with
    prior estimation. While traditional approaches like variational and ensemble Kalman
    filtering have proven effective, recent advances in deep learning offer more scalable,
    efficient, and flexible alternatives better suited for complex, real-world data
    assimilation involving large-scale and multi-modal observations. However, existing
    deep learning-based DA research suffers from two critical limitations: (1) reliance
    on oversimplified scenarios with synthetically perturbed observations, and (2)
    the absence of standardized benchmarks for fair model comparison. To address these
    gaps, in this work, we introduce DAMBench, the first large-scale multi-modal benchmark
    designed to evaluate data-driven DA models under realistic atmospheric conditions.
    DAMBench integrates high-quality background states from state-of-the-art forecasting
    systems and real-world multi-modal observations (i.e., real-world weather stations
    and satellite imagery). All data are resampled to a common grid and temporally
    aligned to support systematic training, validation, and testing. We provide unified
    evaluation protocols and benchmark representative data assimilation approaches,
    including latent generative models and neural process frameworks. Additionally,
    we propose a lightweight multi-modal plugin to demonstrate how integrating realistic
    observations can enhance even simple baselines. Through comprehensive experiments,
    DAMBench establishes a rigorous foundation for future research, promoting reproducibility,
    fair comparison, and extensibility to real-world multi-modal scenarios. Our dataset
    and code are publicly available at https://github.com/figerhaowang/DAMBench.'

  title: The Role of Deep Mesoscale Eddies in Ensemble Forecast Performance
  authors: Justin Cooke, Kathleen Donohue, Clark D Rowley, Prasad G Thoppil, D Randolph
    Watts
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.09747v1
  abstract: Present forecasting efforts rely on assimilation of observational data
    captured in the upper ocean (< 1000 m depth). These observations constrain the
    upper ocean and minimally influence the deep ocean. Nevertheless, development
    of the full water column circulation critically depends upon the dynamical interactions
    between upper and deep fields. Forecasts demonstrate that the initialization of
    the deep field is influential for the development and evolution of the surface
    in the forecast. Deep initial conditions that better agree with observations have
    lower upper ocean uncertainty as the forecast progresses. Here, best and worst
    ensemble members in two 92-day forecasts are identified and contrasted in order
    to determine how the deep ocean differs between these groups. The forecasts cover
    the duration of the Loop Current Eddy Thor separation event, which coincides with
    available deep observations in the Gulf. Model member performance is assessed
    by comparing surface variables against verifying analysis and satellite altimeter
    data during the forecast time-period. Deep cyclonic and anticyclonic features
    are reviewed, and compared against deep observations, indicating subtle differences
    in locations of deep eddies at relevant times. These results highlight both the
    importance of deep circulation in the dynamics of the Loop Current system and
    more broadly motivate efforts to assimilate deep observations to better constrain
    the deep initial fields and improve surface predictions.

  title: 'FlowCast: Advancing Precipitation Nowcasting with Conditional Flow Matching'
  authors: Bernardo Perrone Ribeiro, Jana Faganeli Pucer
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.09731v1
  abstract: 'Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term
    precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood
    risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced
    this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric
    dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models
    have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative
    sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications.
    We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)
    to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data
    mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer
    function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a
    new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals
    the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than
    a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with
    significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and
    practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.'

  title: Physics-based localization methodology for Data Assimilation by Ensemble
    Kalman Filter
  authors: Sarp Er, Marcello Meldi
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.08845v1
  abstract: A physics-based methodology for the determination of the localization
    function for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is proposed. The spatial features
    of such function evolve dynamically over time according to the relevant instantaneous
    flow features of the ensemble members with the objective, to reduce the computational
    cost of the Data Assimilation (DA) procedure when applied with solvers for Computational
    Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The validation of the methodology has been carried out by
    the analysis of two test cases exhibiting different features. This permits to
    investigate different physical features, tailored for each test case, which affect
    the localization function. The flow over a two-dimensional square cylinder at
    $Re=150$ is the first case investigated. It has been shown that the proposed localization
    procedure leads to a more cost-effective DA process by reducing the size of the
    assimilated regions while keeping the same level of accuracy. The capabilities
    of the methodology are further demonstrated by the investigation of the turbulent
    flow around a three-dimensional circular cylinder for $Re=3900$. Again, the methodology
    exhibits an excellent trade off in terms of accuracy versus computational requirements.

  authors: Ziyue Liu, Mohammad Ahmadi Gharehtoragh, Brenna Kari Losch, David R. Johnson
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.07269v1
  abstract: 'Coastal communities can be exposed to risk from catastrophic storm-induced
    coastal hazards, causing major global losses each year. Recent advances in computational
    power have enabled the integration of machine learning (ML) into coastal hazard
    modeling, particularly for storm surge prediction. Given the potential variation
    in future climate and landscape conditions, efficient predictive models that can
    incorporate multiple future scenarios are needed. Existing studies built a framework
    for training ML models using storm surge simulation data under different potential
    future climate and landscape scenarios. However, storm surge simulation data under
    designed future scenarios require computationally expensive numerical simulations
    of synthetic storm suites over extensive geospatial grids. As the number of designed
    scenarios increases, the computational cost associated with both numerical simulation
    and ML training increases rapidly. This study introduces a cost-effective reduction
    strategy that incorporates new scenario data while minimizing computational burden.
    The approach reduces training data across three dimensions: (1) grid points, (2)
    input features, and (3) storm suite size. Reducing the storm suite size is especially
    effective in cutting simulation costs. Model performance was evaluated using different
    ML algorithms, showing consistent effectiveness. When trained on 5,000 of 80,000

  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.15350v1
  abstract: Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine
    learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular
    tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized,
    with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper,
    we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We
    evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world
    datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though
    no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose
    a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that
    combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method
    consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios.
    Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML
    systems for time series forecasting.

  title: 'Towards Streaming Prediction of Oscillatory Flows: A Data Assimilation and
    Machine Learning Approach'
  authors: Miguel M. Valero, Marcello Meldi
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.15758v1
  abstract: Data-driven methods have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities in
    fluid mechanics, yet most current applications still focus on simplified configurations,
    often characterised by statistical stationarity or limited temporal variability.
    This work proposes a methodology that combines Data Assimilation (DA) and Machine
    Learning (ML) to predict flow configurations that exhibit cyclic behaviour over
    time. Starting from limited, sparse high-fidelity measurements and a low-fidelity
    numerical model, the DA approach performs data fusion to obtain complete and accurate
    flow state estimations in time. This complete dataset is used to train multiple
    ML tools, which are applied across different phases of the flow cycle to augment
    the model's predictions when high-fidelity data might not be available for the
    DA application. The methodology is applied to the analysis of an oscillating cylinder
    in a laminar regime using a sliding-window approach, in which separate models
    are trained for specific flow conditions to ensure each model specialises in flow
    dynamics representative of a phase of the oscillation period. This phase-resolved
    learning enables the efficient capture of transient features that would be challenging
    for a single global model. The results highlight the potential of this method
    to study complex flow configurations with oscillatory features in which neither
    the flow nor the cycle is known a priori, in particular by exploiting real-time
    training and updates, as is commonly done in digital twins, which require continuous
    model correction and adaptation.

  title: 'Weather Maps as Tokens: Transformers for Renewable Energy Forecasting'
  authors: Federico Battini
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.13935v2
  abstract: 'Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence
    on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches
    fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with
    their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather
    maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather
    maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network,
    and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour
    forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against
    ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60% and 20% for
    wind and solar respectively. A live dashboard showing daily forecasts is available

  title: Exploring Ultra Rapid Data Assimilation Based on Ensemble Transform Kalman
    Filter with the Lorenz 96 Model
  authors: Fumitoshi Kawasaki, Atsushi Okazaki, Kenta Kurosawa, Shunji Kotsuki
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.12620v1
  abstract: To explore the effectiveness of ultra-rapid data assimilation (URDA) for
    numerical weather prediction (NWP), this study investigates the properties of
    URDA in nonlinear models and proposes technical treatments to enhance its performance.
    URDA rapidly updates preemptive forecasts derived from observations without integrating
    a dynamical model each time additional observations become available. First, we
    analytically demonstrate that the preemptive forecast obtained by URDA in nonlinear
    models is approximately equivalent to the forecast integrated from the analysis.
    Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted with the 40-variable Lorenz 96
    model. The results show that URDA in nonlinear models tends to exhibit deterioration
    of forecast accuracy and collapse of ensemble spread when preemptive forecasts
    are repeatedly updated or when the forecasts are extended over longer periods.
    Furthermore, the roles of inflation and localization, both essential technical
    treatments in NWP, are examined in the context of URDA. It is shown that although
    inflation and localization are essential to URDA, conventional inflation techniques
    are not suitable for it. Therefore, this study proposes new technical treatments
    for URDA, namely relaxation to baseline perturbations (RTBP) and relaxation to
    baseline forecast (RTBF). Applying RTBP and RTBF mitigates the difficulties associated
    with URDA and yields preemptive forecasts with higher accuracy than the baseline
    forecast. Consequently, URDA, particularly when combined with RTBP and RTBF, would
    stand as a step toward practical application in NWP.

  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2511.20508v1
  abstract: 'Weather is a dominant external driver of residential electricity demand,
    but adding many meteorological covariates can inflate model complexity and may
    even impair accuracy. Selecting appropriate exogenous features is non-trivial
    and calls for a principled selection framework, given the direct operational implications
    for day-to-day planning and reliability. This work investigates whether causal
    feature selection can retain the most informative weather drivers while improving
    parsimony and robustness for short-term load forecasting. We present a case study
    on Southern Ontario with two open-source datasets: (i) IESO hourly electricity
    consumption by Forward Sortation Areas; (ii) ERA5 weather reanalysis data. We
    compare different feature selection regimes (no feature selection, non-causal
    selection, PCMCI-causal selection) on city-level forecasting with three different
    time series forecasting models: GRU, TCN, PatchTST. In the feature analysis, non-causal
    selection prioritizes radiation and moisture variables that show correlational
    dependence, whereas PCMCI-causal selection emphasizes more direct thermal drivers
    and prunes the indirect covariates. We detail the evaluation pipeline and report
    diagnostics on prediction accuracy and extreme-weather robustness, positioning
    causal feature selection as a practical complement to modern forecasters when
    integrating weather into residential load forecasting.'

    Forecasting
  authors: Salim Khazem, Houssam Kanso
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2512.03656v1
  abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is essential for demand management
    and smart grid operations. This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework
    that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures
    to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based
    attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate
    their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term
    seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed
    of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast
    horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive
    experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings
    and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature.
    Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons,
    with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures
    and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal
    representations with complementary deep learning structures. To our knowledge,
    this is the first work to jointly evaluate temporal encodings, calendar-based
    features, and hybrid ensemble architectures within a unified short-term energy
    forecasting framework.

  authors: Matteo Peduto, Qidong Yang, Jonathan Giezendanner, Devis Tuia, Sherrie
    Wang
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2512.03606v1
  abstract: Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship
    routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations
    over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate
    wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather
    prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local
    correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust
    the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning
    architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through
    masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent
    observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time
    embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass
    inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic
    Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere
    Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all
    lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13%
    improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent
    improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most
    abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing
    platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both
    site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward
    pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach
    that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.

  arxiv: 2512.02260v1
  abstract: Increasing climate change and habitat loss are driving unprecedented shifts
    in species distributions. Conservation professionals urgently need timely, high-resolution
    predictions of biodiversity risks, especially in ecologically diverse regions
    like Africa. We propose EcoCast, a spatio-temporal model designed for continual
    biodiversity and climate risk forecasting. Utilizing multisource satellite imagery,
    climate data, and citizen science occurrence records, EcoCast predicts near-term
    (monthly to seasonal) shifts in species distributions through sequence-based transformers
    that model spatio-temporal environmental dependencies. The architecture is designed
    with support for continual learning to enable future operational deployment with
    new data streams. Our pilot study in Africa shows promising improvements in forecasting
    distributions of selected bird species compared to a Random Forest baseline, highlighting
    EcoCast's potential to inform targeted conservation policies. By demonstrating
    an end-to-end pipeline from multi-modal data ingestion to operational forecasting,
    EcoCast bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and biodiversity
    management, ultimately guiding data-driven strategies for climate resilience and
    ecosystem conservation throughout Africa.

  title: Are we misdiagnosing ensemble forecast reliability? On the insufficiency
    of Spread-Error and rank-based reliability metrics
  authors: Arlan Dirkson, Mark Buehner
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2512.02160v1
  abstract: It has been documented that Spread-Error equality and a flat rank histogram
    are necessary but insufficient for demonstrating ensemble forecast reliability.
    Nevertheless, these metrics are heavily relied upon, both in the literature and
    at operational numerical weather prediction centers. In this study, we demonstrate
    theoretically why the Spread-Error relationship is necessary but insufficient
    for diagnosing reliability up to second order, even when mean bias is absent or
    accounted for. Assuming joint normality between ensemble members and the reference
    truth, we further show with idealized experiments that the same covariance structure
    responsible for this insufficiency also produces false diagnoses of reliability
    with the rank histogram and the reliability component of the continuous rank probability
    score. Under this structure and when the ensemble mean is meaningfully different
    from climatology, the truth lies among the least (most) extreme members when climatological
    variance is excessive (deficient) in each member. Importantly, this behavior is
    also shown to be plausible in operational ensemble weather forecasts. Combining
    these results with calibration principles from statistical postprocessing leads
    us to conclude that both perfect dispersion and underdispersion are ill-defined.
    When diagnostics are misinterpreted as indicating the latter, improper tuning
    can lead to further deterioration of forecast quality, even while improving Spread-Error
    and rank histogram behavior. To address these issues, we propose a new reliability
    diagnostic based on three easily computed statistics, motivated by the structure
    of the joint distribution of ensemble members and the reference truth up to second
    order. The diagnostic separates contributions to unreliability originating from
    climatology and predictability, enabling a more precise and robust characterization
    of ensemble behavior.

    performance of generative downscaling models across diverse regions. Using a global
    framework, we employ ERA5 reanalysis data as predictors and IMERG precipitation
    estimates at $0.1^\circ$ resolution as targets. A hierarchical location-based
    data split enables a systematic assessment of model performance across 15 regions

  title: Data assimilation and discrepancy modeling with shallow recurrent decoders
  authors: Yuxuan Bao, J. Nathan Kutz
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2512.01170v1
  abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing
    demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited
    sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the
    integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific
    computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models,
    however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to
    perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions
    that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical
    need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with
    predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the
    full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework
    for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges
    the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental
    sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
    fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred
    from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced
    simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor
    data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm
    incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model
    in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics
    in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the
    SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems,
    demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed
    correction enables robust data assimilation.

  title: 'PIANO: Physics-informed Dual Neural Operator for Precipitation Nowcasting'
  authors: Seokhyun Chin, Junghwan Park, Woojin Cho
  year: 2025
  arxiv: 2512.01062v1
  abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, key for early warning of disasters, currently
    relies on computationally expensive and restrictive methods that limit access
    to many countries. To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting
    using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical
    consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure
    to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to
    predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to
    convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting.
    Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in
    moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h)
    precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability
    in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization. This study suggests
    the potential of the PIANO and serves as a good baseline for physics-informed
    precipitation nowcasting.

  abstract: "The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission has laid\
    \ a foundation for advancing real-time space weather forecasting by enabling the\
    \ evaluation of heliospheric imager (HI) data for predicting coronal mass ejection\
    \ (CME) arrivals at Earth. This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how\
    \ incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance\
    \ prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing\
    \ for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation\
    \ of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking\
    \ variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three\
    \ different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting\
    \ outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation\
    \ directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising\
    \ the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential\
    \ of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when\
    \ integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from\
    \ beyond 35\xB0 elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising\
    \ real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming\
    \ Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events."

  abstract: 'Reliable regional climate information is essential for assessing the
    impacts of climate change and for planning in sectors such as renewable energy;
    yet, producing high-resolution projections through coordinated initiatives like
    CORDEX that run multiple physical regional climate models is both computationally
    demanding and difficult to organize. Machine learning emulators that learn the
    mapping between global and regional climate fields offer a promising way to address
    these limitations. Here we introduce the application of such an emulator: trained
    on CMIP5 and CORDEX simulations, it reproduces regional climate model data with
    sufficient accuracy. When applied to CMIP6 simulations not seen during training,
    it also produces realistic results, indicating stable performance. Using CORDEX
    data, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, as well as regional data generated by two machine
    learning models, we analyze the co-occurrence of low wind speed and low solar
    radiation and find indications that the number of such energy drought days is
    likely to decrease in the future. Our results highlight that downscaling with
    machine learning emulators provides an efficient complement to efforts such as
    CORDEX, supplying the higher-resolution information required for impact assessments.'
