**Abstract:**
> Data assimilation is the process of incorporating observations into a numerical model to improve its initial conditions. We present FengWu-4DVar, a data-driven weather forecasting model that is coupled with a 4D variational assimilation system. FengWu-4DVar uses a deep neural network to learn the model error and then uses this information to correct the forecast. We show that FengWu-4DVar can significantly improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, especially for long-range predictions. The model is also able to assimilate a wide range of observations, including satellite data, radar data, and ground-based measurements.
