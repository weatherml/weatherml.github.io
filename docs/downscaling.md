**Abstract:**
> Downscaling is the process of increasing the resolution of a weather forecast. We present MambaDS, a deep learning model for downscaling near-surface meteorological fields. MambaDS uses a selective state-space model to capture the complex relationships between large-scale atmospheric circulation and local weather conditions. The model is constrained by high-resolution topography data to ensure that the downscaled fields are physically consistent. We show that MambaDS can produce high-resolution forecasts that are more accurate than those produced by traditional statistical downscaling methods.
