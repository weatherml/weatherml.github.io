### GenCast: Diffusion-based ensemble forecasting for medium-range weather

**Authors:** J. A. Weyn, J. D. Herman, and D. J. Gagne II

**Year:** 2024

**Abstract:**
> We introduce GenCast, a generative machine learning model for creating medium-range ensemble weather forecasts. GenCast uses a diffusion model to generate a diverse set of possible future weather states, providing a measure of forecast uncertainty. We show that GenCast can produce reliable and sharp ensemble forecasts that are competitive with state-of-the-art operational ensemble systems. GenCast represents a new paradigm for ensemble forecasting that has the potential to improve our ability to predict high-impact weather events.

### SwinVRNN: A Data-Driven Ensemble Forecasting Model via Learned Distribution Perturbation

**Authors:** Yuan-Hao Lee, Chih-Yao Ma

**Year:** 2023

**Abstract:**
> Ensemble forecasting is a crucial technique for quantifying uncertainty in weather prediction. We propose SwinVRNN, a data-driven ensemble forecasting model that learns to generate diverse and realistic weather scenarios. SwinVRNN combines a Swin Transformer with a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) to model the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere. The model is trained to perturb the initial conditions of a forecast based on a learned distribution, resulting in a diverse set of ensemble members. We show that SwinVRNN can generate ensembles that are more skillful and reliable than those produced by traditional methods.
