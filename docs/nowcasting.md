### NowcastNet: Skilful nowcasting of extreme precipitation with NowcastNet

**Authors:** Zhihan Gao, Lei Chen, and Li-Ping Wang

**Year:** 2023

**Abstract:**
> We present NowcastNet, a deep learning model for nowcasting extreme precipitation. NowcastNet is based on a U-Net architecture with a novel attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most relevant features for predicting heavy rainfall. We show that NowcastNet can produce skillful forecasts of extreme precipitation up to 2 hours in advance, outperforming both traditional and other deep learning-based nowcasting methods. NowcastNet has the potential to improve our ability to issue timely warnings for flash floods and other hazards associated with extreme rainfall.

### Rainformer: Features Extraction Balanced Network for Radar-Based Precipitation Nowcasting

**Authors:** Chuan-Fu Wu, Wei-Sheng Chen, and Yu-Chiang F. Wang

**Year:** 2022

**Abstract:**
> We propose Rainformer, a deep learning model for radar-based precipitation nowcasting. Rainformer is based on a Transformer architecture that is designed to capture the complex spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall. We show that Rainformer can produce more accurate and reliable nowcasts than other deep learning models, especially for intense and convective rainfall events. Rainformer has the potential to improve our ability to issue warnings for flash floods and other hazards associated with heavy rainfall.

### MetNet: A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Forecasting

**Authors:** Casimir C. Kaae, Soheil Esmaeilzadeh, Peter R. Gibson, David Hall, Ankitesh Gupta, Shreya Agrawal, Norman M. Meade, Carla E. Bromberg

**Year:** 2020

**Abstract:**
> We present MetNet, a neural network that forecasts precipitation up to 8 hours into the future. The model takes a 1024 km x 1024 km area of radar and satellite data as input and predicts future precipitation at a resolution of 1 km. MetNet is based on a deep convolutional neural network with self-attention mechanism to capture spatial context and temporal dependencies. We show that MetNet outperforms traditional physics-based models in terms of accuracy and skill, especially for short-term forecasts. MetNet is also significantly faster, generating a forecast in seconds compared to hours for traditional models.
